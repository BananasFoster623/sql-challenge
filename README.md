# sql-challenge

### Deliverables
1. QuickDBD ERD.PNG
    - Screenshot of the ERD
2. createtable.sql
    - This is a .sql file with all of the CREATE TABLE commands used to create the database. 
3. pgAdmin4_schema_dump.sql
    - This is the schema of the database, created from the Backup>Dump function in pgAdmin 4. It is not quite as readable as just SQL queries, so items (2) and (3) were both included.
4. sql-challenge.sql
    - This is the file with all of the queries as defined by the problem statement.
